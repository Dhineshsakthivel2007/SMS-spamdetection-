üì© SMS Spam Detection Web App

Live Demo: https://smsspamdetectionn.streamlit.app/

Welcome to the SMS Spam Detection Web App! This application leverages machine learning to classify SMS messages as either Spam or Not Spam. Built using Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn, it offers an intuitive interface for users to upload datasets and make predictions.

üöÄ Features

Model Selection: Choose from various machine learning models, including:

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Multinomial Naive Bayes

Bernoulli Naive Bayes

Automatic Data Processing: Upon uploading a CSV file:

The dataset is loaded and preprocessed.

Features such as word frequencies and message length are extracted.

The data is split into training and testing sets.

Model Training & Evaluation:

Train the selected model on the training data.

Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Real-time SMS Prediction: Input a new SMS message to predict whether it's spam or not, along with the associated probabilities.

üìä Dataset Format

The application expects a CSV file with the following columns:

label: Indicates whether the message is spam (1) or ham (0).

text: The content of the SMS message.

Example:

label	text
0	Hey, how are you?
1	Congratulations! You've won a prize!
